# json-minimal-tests

This software extracts minimal tests from the source codes contained in a repo
when there are differences between the metrics computed before and after an
update of a language parser. The comparisons are made using the JSON files
produced by rust-code-analysis.

# Installing

Run `cargo install json-minimal-tests` or download the binaries contained in the
[release](https://github.com/Luni-4/json-minimal-tests/releases/) page.
